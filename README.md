* Discussing design setup/layout/etc
* Deciding on how to best collaborate


## DETAILS:
* What: Baseball Game
* Skill Level: Novice to Intermediate
* Style: 2D prototype to get started with a plan to move to 3D
* Language: Open to discussion - Most likely is C#
* Commitment: 2-3 hours / week (mostly Saturdays)
* Design/Communication Platforms: Unity / GitHub / Discord

## Who am I?

I'm a new coder currently attending a coding boot camp. My focus is web development, but I've found myself bored of playing games and I'm dying to make one instead. I'm fairly new to front-end style web development, but I'm looking to build something collaboratively because I think it would be extremely educational from a project construction and collaboration standpoint.

Ideally, I'd like to find people who are Beginner/Intermediate programmers to start with. Some art/music aspects might be included, but I'm okay with having bad art and horrible music.

However, I'm open to having one team member who is really good at this stuff and willing to walk the rest of us noobs through some of these processes. Lacking that, I'm okay with all 4 of us being noobs and figuring it out together.

## Why Baseball?

Baseball has a very defined set of rules already. My focus for this project is not to develop a new game to sell, but rather to figure out all those pesky pieces in between that nobody seems to be talking about at a low enough level.

E.G. How to collaborate on GitHub, link Unity work to your project, communicate with your team members, track progress, assign and complete tasks, and if all goes well, how to actually go about improving and publishing the finished product, and patching it moving forward to something like Steam

With baseball as a model to use, we won't need to spend time trying to come up with how the game itself works. That way we can focus on how to build it from the ground up. It's sort of like having the picture on the outside of a puzzle box. We know what the picture looks like. Let's put it together... together. The 4 team members are the corner pieces.

## What's been done so far?

I have a Discord server and a GitHub group up and running. Although those are not the main focus of this project, I'd like to have anyone interested involved with both of those to get started. I'm also open to using another form of collaboration if someone with more experience has found a great solution.

## Who should reply?

* If you bring to the table any of the following, you're perfect for this:
* Coder in boot camp looking to further skills (html/css/js/c#)
* Beginner/Intermediate skill in Unity
* Beginner/Intermediate skill using git
* Advanced skill with any of the above and the patience to teach
* Beginner/Intermediate skill as an artist/musician && any of the above
* You're okay working with those who already have other jobs/kids/commitments and can't commit 100% of their time
* You're okay with committing some time (2-3 hrs / week) independently or as a team



## I'm interested, now what?

Please send me a message with how you fit the "who should reply" section. We can go from there.
