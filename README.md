# Where are we at with this?
- [View the Wiki page](https://github.com/knights-of-balmoral/2D-Baseball/wiki) for details.
- Learning continues for the Godot engine. It is extremely fast when compared to Unity. Documentation is starting to become more abundant on it as well.
- Recommended watching: [Godot Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mc13Z2gboEk&list=PLhqJJNjsQ7KF0o0ke_CA2QlqK8BxQNSFS)

## Who are we?

### Stryyder

I'm a new coder currently attending a coding boot camp. My focus is web development, but I've found myself bored of playing games and I'm dying to make one instead. I'm fairly new to front-end style web development, but I'm looking to build something collaboratively because I think it would be extremely educational from a project construction and collaboration standpoint. One of the first games I ever made was in QBasic. It was called [Danger House](https://github.com/Stryyder/Danger-House).

### Baaleras

I have only old school game development experience from back in the MUD days. I ran and modified several different MUDS over the years. Mostly experience in C and GCC. No formal training in programming. Lots to learn, but up for a challenge.

## Why Baseball?

Baseball has a very defined set of rules already. My focus for this project is not to develop a new game to sell, but rather to figure out all those pesky pieces in between that nobody seems to be talking about at a low enough level.

E.G. How to collaborate on GitHub, link Unity work to your project, communicate with your team members, track progress, assign and complete tasks, and if all goes well, how to actually go about improving and publishing the finished product, and patching it moving forward to something like Steam

With baseball as a model to use, we won't need to spend time trying to come up with how the game itself works. That way we can focus on how to build it from the ground up. It's sort of like having the picture on the outside of a puzzle box. We know what the picture looks like. Let's put it together... together.
